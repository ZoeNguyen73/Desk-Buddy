## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Category | Tools / Libraries |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML • CSS (Flexbox + responsive) • Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules) |
| **Backend / API Proxy** | Netlify Functions (serverless) |
| **External APIs** | icanhazdadjoke • Meme API • ZenQuotes • Humor API |
| **Hosting** | GitHub Pages (frontend) • Netlify (backend) |
| **Storage** | Local Storage (for caching quotes and remembering username) |

## 🧠 Development Process & Key Learnings

Desk Buddy began as my **first end-to-end web project** to apply fundamental web-dev concepts while learning modular design.

**Core Concepts Practised**
- Object-Oriented Programming for cleaner component separation  
- Event-driven architecture connecting the Timer, ChatComponent, and Event classes  
- Asynchronous logic for API calls and user interactions  
- Secure API key handling via Netlify Functions  
- Responsive layout and polished UX (details like loading states and reaction emojis)

---

## 🧩 Technical Highlights & Challenges

| Area | Approach / Solution |
|------|---------------------|
| **Event timing logic** | Implemented a recursive `setTimeout()` loop to schedule chat events dynamically. |
| **Async API delays** | Added loading cursors and disabled buttons until responses render. |
| **Data flow between modules** | Centralized configuration object and event list for state management. |
| **DOM organization** | Built `Message`, `MessageWithClickEvent`, and `ChatComponent` classes for structured updates. |
| **Styling issues** | Leveraged Flexbox and absolute positioning for chat layout and reaction emoji placement. |

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Think in **components** and separate concerns early — even in vanilla JS.  
- **Visualize data flow** between modules to reduce state bugs.  
- Handle asynchronous events gracefully with user feedback.  
- Keep API keys secure by off-loading calls to serverless functions.  
- Maintain clear commits and documentation for scalability.

## 🧪 Future Improvements

- 🎵 Spotify API integration for background music  
- 🤖 AI-powered chat responses (personalized buddy conversations)  
- 🎨 Theme & avatar customization  
- 🗓️ Scheduled auto-start / auto-end sessions  
- 🗒️ Built-in notepad for quick ideas
